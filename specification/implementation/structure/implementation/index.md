## 4.2.	Implementing the structure
The requirements presented in Section 4.1 leave room for decisions during the implementation. For the sake of clarity we provide examples for two extremes – the simplest and the full use of the structure.

In the simplest case the structure can be implemented following mostly just the MUST requirements. An example of this is visible on Figure 9.

The main point to highlight with such a simple use is that the representations have been kept as simple as possible. All metadata about both the package and the representations (in this example METS, EAD and
PREMIS metadata) are located in the Information Package folder and none of these components are available within the representation folders.

Such a simple implementation is reasonable in scenarios where the amount of data and metadata is limited. However, in the case of large Information Packages (for example, a package including three representations and 1,000,000 files in one representation) the size of both the `METS.xml` file and preservation metadata can grow too large to manage efficiently. Especially in such large data scenarios it might prove necessary to implement all the capabilities of the structure presented in the previous Section.

An example of the full implementation is delivered in Figure 10. The main difference between the simple and full use of the structure is that each representation does essentially repeat the simple structure. Especially structural and preservation metadata in METS and PREMIS formats is available in both the Information Package folder (for package level descriptions) and within representation folders (for representation level descriptions). As such the full structure allows for easier management of single representations and brings further benefits like more straight-forward metadata versioning. It is worth to note that, in order to avoid confusion, it is recommended to have a common approach towards adding metadata into representations or not. In other words, we recommend having all representation-relevant metadata either in the root metadata folder or the representation metadata folder, but not to have a mixed approach (i.e. some representation metadata in the root metadata folder and some within the representation). Further, we do not recommend the duplication of any metadata or the content of optional folders (schemas, documentation, etc.) between the Information Package folder and representation folders.
