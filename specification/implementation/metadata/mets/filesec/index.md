### 5.3.5.	Use of the METS file section (element fileSec)
Use of the METS fileSec element is highly recommended by the CSIP (although not mandatory). It should describe all components of the IP which have not been already included in the amdSec and dmdSec elements. For all files the location and checksum need to be available. Therefore the main purpose of the
METS file section is to serve as a “table of contents” or “manifest” and allow validating the integrity of the files included into the package.


The main requirement of the CSIP is that the file section of both the root and representation METS files includes at least one file group (element fileGrp) grouping together files.  CSIP structures the different files into structural components (i.e. documentation, schemas, data) which are described by its own fileGrp element. Representations including their own METS files, the components (including data files) of a representation should be described only in the representation METS. The root METS file should still include a fileGrp for each representation but only reference the METS.xml file of the representation.

The specific requirements for elements, sub-elements and attributes are listed in the following table. Note that use of the stream and transformFile elements are not discussed below. Implementers wishing to use either of these METS elements should follow the requirements in the METS documentation.
