### 5.3.3 Use of the METS descriptive metadata section (element dmdSec)

The purpose of the METS descriptive data section is to embed or refer to files containing descriptive metadata.

The CS IP as such does not make any assumptions on the use of specific descriptive metadata schemas. As such, implementers are welcome to use descriptive metadata following any standards inside a CS IP package.

Specific elements for which the exact use is fixed within this specification are highlighted in the following table.
