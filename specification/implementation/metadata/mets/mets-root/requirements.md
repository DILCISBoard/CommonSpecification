| ID | Name & Location | Description & usage | Cardinality & Level |
| -- | --------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| <a name="CSIP1"></a>**CSIP1** | **Content Identification** <br/> `mets/@OBJID` | It is mandatory to use a content ID which is expressed with @OBJID. The value should be the same as the name or ID of the package (the name of the root folder) for the root METS document or the name and folder name for the representation. The OBJID must meet the principle of being unique at least across the repository. | **1..1** <br/> MUST |
| <a name="CSIP2"></a>**CSIP2** | **General content type** <br/> `mets/@TYPE` | The @TYPE attribute must be used for identifying the general type of the package (genre). A vocabulary is used. The vocabulary is going to evolve under the care of the DILCIS Board as additional content information type specifications are developed. <br/> **See also:** <a href="#VocabularyType" >Content information type declaration</a> | **1..1** <br/> MUST |
| <a name="CSIP3"></a>**CSIP3** | **Other general content type** <br/> `mets/@csip:OTHERTYPE` | The @csip:OTHERTYPE attribute must be used for stating the general type of the package (genre) when @TYPE has the value "OTHER" <br/> **See also:** <a href="#VocabularyType" >Content information type declaration</a> | **0..1** <br/> SHOULD |
| <a name="CSIP4"></a>**CSIP4** | **Specific content type** <br/> `mets/@csip:CONTENTINFORMATIONTYPE` | An added attribute which describes the specific content information type specification used for the transferred content. The attribute is mandatory to use when the METS document describes a representation. The vocabulary is going to evolve under the care of the DILCIS Board as additional content information type specifications are developed. <br/> **See also:** <a href="#VocabularyContentInformationTypeSpecification" >Content information type specification name</a> | **1..1** <br/> SHOULD |
| <a name="CSIP5"></a>**CSIP5** | **Other specific content type** <br/> `mets/@csip:OTHERCONTENTINFORMATIONTYPE` | When the @csip:CONTENTINFORMATIONTYPE uses the value "OTHER" the @csip:OTHERCONTENTINFORMATIONTYPE must describe the content. | **0..1** <br/> MAY |
| <a name="CSIP6"></a>**CSIP6** | **METS Profile** <br/> `mets/@PROFILE` | The PROFILE attribute has to have as its value the URL of the profile used for describing the package. | **1..1** <br/> MUST |
| <a name="CSIP7"></a>**CSIP7** | **Namespace declarations** <br/> `mets/@xmlns` | All XML namespaces used in the METS.xml document MUST be declared in `mets/@xmlns` attributes. A valid CSIP METS.xml document needs at least the declarations for `METS`, `CSIPExtensionMETS` and `XMLSchema-instance`, and in most cases also `xlink`. | **3..n** <br/> MUST |
| <a name="CSIP8"></a>**CSIP8** | **Schema locations** <br/> `mets/@xsi:schemaLocation` | The actual locations of XSD files for all used XML namespaces MUST be declared in the `mets/@xsi:schemaLocation` attribute. <br/> The schema files are needed at the time of validation, so they should be stored at a location accessible throughout the lifetime of the IP, or included in the `schemas` folder. In the latter case, it is recommended to link to the schemas using the relative path (e.g. `schemas/mets.xsd`). <br/> Note 1: it is assumed here that `xsi` has been declared as the prefix for `XMLSchema-instance` namespace, but this choice is not mandatory. <br/> Note 2: The xsd file location for `XMLSchema-instance` does not have to be shown because of its special, built-in status. | **1..1** <br/> MUST |
