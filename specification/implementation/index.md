# PART II: Implementation of the CSIP

In this part of the document we present an implementation of the requirements and principles presented in Part I of the specifciation for CS IP. The implementation consists of two core elements: a fixed physical structure of a CS IP Information Package (Section 4) and the exact use of metadata using the "Metadata Encoding & Transmission Standard" (METS) http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/ and "PREservation Metadata Implementation Strategies" (PREMIS) http://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/ format (Section 5).

As explained earlier, any implementation using a metadata standard is will inevitably become obsolete. However, the authors have reused available best practices and established standards, and held discussions with the digital preservation community to ensure that the implementation is as future proof as possible.
