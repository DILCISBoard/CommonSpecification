The Common Specification for Information Packages was first developed within the E-ARK project in 2014 – 2017. E-ARK was an EC-funded pilot action project in the Competiveness and Innovation Programme 2007- 2013, Grant Agreement no. 620998 under the Policy Support Programme.

We would like to thank the National Archives of Sweden and Karin Bredenberg for their support and the availability of the Swedish national Common Specifications, upon which most of this document has been built.

The authors of this deliverable would like to thank all national archives, tool developers and other stakeholders who provided valuable knowledge about their requirements for information packages and feedback to this specification!
