TODO ?
------
- [ ] Decide if we want to retain old schema in the archive. Perhaps the archive should store previous versions of the specification site?
- [ ] Travis build and test
 + [ ] build and test requirement table generator
 + [ ] test generation of requirements and site
 + [ ] broken links test for site
 + [ ] spell check for text, if feasible and useful
- [ ] Navigation for specification documents
  + Possibly via GH pages YAML metadata
