E-ARK Common Specification for Information Packages
===================================================

Quick Start
-----------

### Layout
```
E-ARK-CSIP/
Project root
  |
  |- archive/
  |  Archive of old versions of the specification (possibly schema, see TODOs).
  |
  |- examples/
  |  Sample information packages showing the Common Specification in use.
  |
  |- specification/
  |  The Markdown source for the common specification.
  |
  |- README.md
  |  This documentation file.
  |
  |- index.md
     The Markdown source for the site home page.
```

TODO
----
- [] Decide if we want to retain old schema in the archive. Perhaps the archive should store previous versions of the specification site?
